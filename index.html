Along with including the basic information that students needed to know, I included a few activities like multiple choice and matching, these included scenarios to make it more realistic.  Each response received individual feedback helping the student learn more about safeguarding.  One specific one gave a scenario of a safeguarding event and students needed to determine what would happen next.  This was to show them how safeguarding events are handled. </div></li>

You start with an idea of what you want to create and then you need to break it down, figuring out what each part needs to do and how to program it to get it to work. You even use problem solving to fix bugs or code that is not working as planned.  An example would be of this webpage for the skills to show at a certain size and how to get the column to stay that size if you open more than one and then close one.  Having it add an open class when you open a section that makes it visible and makes the frame wider is the first part, but when you click close if you opened multiple skills under a section it can’t just remove the open class as it will remove all of them which will make the column width smaller while sections are still open.  To fix this problem, I put the value of the element’s classname attribute into a variable and removed the last 5 characters, essentially removing one open class then changed the classname to that variable.  This solved that problem.  </div></li>
